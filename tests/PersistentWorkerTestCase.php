/**
 * Dispatches several requests through one application instance, using Octane's real Worker.
 *
 * Winter's ordinary test cases build a fresh application for every test method, which is the exact
 * opposite of how a persistent application server behaves and means no conventional test can
 * observe state crossing a request boundary. This base class boots Laravel\Octane\Worker once and
 * hands every request to Worker::handle(), so the sandbox cloning, event order, output buffering,
 * error handling and post-request restoration are Octane's own code rather than a reimplementation
 * of it. The one substitution is the application factory: the worker is given the application this
 * test case has already prepared (migrations run, plugin registered) instead of bootstrapping a
 * second one.
 *
 * Responses and errors are collected from the worker's client, which is where a real server would
 * receive them. An exception that escapes the HTTP kernel therefore reaches the tests the same way
 * it reaches production: through Client::error() and the WorkerErrorOccurred event, with
 * RequestTerminated never dispatched.
 *
 * Extends PluginTestCase so the Winter.Octane plugin is registered into the application under
 * test: the request-boundary reset these tests observe is attached by the plugin's register(),
 * exactly as it is in production.
